The notebook takes a content image and a style image as input. It combines the two images and generates a generated image as output. It utilizes the pre-trained VGG19 CNN model architecture to extract image features from style and content images, finally combining them to generate an output image.
It also store the output images at different epochs to show the progress of style transfer.
